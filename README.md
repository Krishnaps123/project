Recent rapid technological advancements in online social networks such as
Twitter have led to a great incline in spreading false information and fake news.
Misinformation is especially prevalent in the ongoing coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic, leading to individuals accepting bogus and potentially
deleterious claims and articles. Quick detection of fake news can reduce the
spread of panic and confusion among the public. In this project analyze the
reliability of information pertaining to COVID 19 pandemic. This approach is
based on an ensemble of three transformer models (BERT, ALBERT,and
XLNET) to detect fake news.In this project I compare the best three models
and produce the essemble of model of the above. The methodology is used by
Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency(TF-ID) features to detect
misinformation on the provided dataset.These supervised TF-IDF methods are
still relevant for many classification tasks and performed pretty well for fake
news detection.
